This is my website. Its purpose is to provide verry little information about who I am and what I
do and - of course - important links like github, stackoverflow, bitbucket and so on.

This site gets automatically deployed by https://www.netlify.com/

I am horribly bad at frontend stuff. If you are familiar with web developement, its likely that your eyes start bleeding
by viewing my code. So please HELP ME!! to make this site viewable by contributing here.
Just fork this repo and create a Pull request. Thank you :heart:
